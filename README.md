## Resources

- [Outline Offset](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_outline-offset.asp) - I used this link to apply a CSS outline around my articles.
- [Super Embed](https://github.com/corbindavenport/superembed.js) - This plugin makes videos (like the Vine on the bottom of the page) adjust its size to the broswer's dimensions.
- [Goup](https://github.com/Ryuk87/jquery-goup) - This plugin makes a button appear as you scroll down the page that can be clicked to return to the top of the page. It's on the bottom right corner as you scroll down.

## Comments

- One jQuery code I used was to hide my contact information. When you hover over the Contact artcile, the text disappears and is replaced with an email link.
- The other jQuery code I used was when you hover over my image, the title adds another line and says "Web Designer".
